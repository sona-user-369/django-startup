# Django Startup 🚀

**Django Startup** is a lightweight library designed to help developers quickly scaffold and set up a Django environment with pre-integrated functions and operations. Whether you're starting a new project or need to streamline your development process, Django Startup automates the creation of essential files and configurations to get you up and running faster!

## Features ✨

- **File & Package Generation**: Automatically generates key files and packages, including the default authentication app.
- **Pre-configured `settings.py`**: Includes all the necessary configurations to make your Django setup work right out of the box.
- **App Boilerplate**: Generates serializers, utility functions, and views for any new app you create.
- **Documentation Generation**: Automatically generates initial documentation for your Django app to help onboard new team members or improve project clarity.
- **Test Pipelines**: Sets up a testing pipeline for views, ensuring your code is always production-ready.
- **Data Samples**: Generates sample data for models, so you can start testing and developing immediately.
- **Model-based Serializer Generation**: Automatically creates serializers based on your Django models to reduce boilerplate code.

## Installation 🛠️

To get started with Django Startup, simply install it via `pip`:

```bash
pip install django-startup
```

## Quick Start 🚀

Once installed, you can quickly start a new Django project with pre-configured features by following these steps:

1. **Create a new Django project**:

   ```bash
   djs project your_project_name
   ```

2. **Install Django Startup** in your project’s virtual environment:

   ```bash
   pip install django-startup
   ```

3. **Generate your app boilerplate** by running:

   ```bash
   python manage.py generate_app your_app_name
   ```

   This will create necessary files like serializers, utils, views, and even sample data for your app!

4. **Run migrations and start your server**:

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

   You are now ready to start building your Django app with less manual setup!

## Configuration 🔧

The `settings.py` file comes pre-configured with essential Django settings, including default configurations for:

- **Database settings** (supports default SQLite setup, but easily customizable)
- **Authentication & Permissions** (with default Auth app included)
- **Static & Media Files** configuration
- **Logging, Caching, and Security settings**

## Documentation 📚

Django Startup automatically generates a starting point for your project’s documentation, including:

- A README template
- App-specific documentation
- Example API documentation

This helps you maintain project clarity and improve onboarding for new contributors.

## Tests 🧪

Django Startup sets up a test pipeline for your views, so you can focus on writing business logic rather than worrying about testing setup.

- Automatically creates test cases for each view.
- Provides sample test data based on the generated models.

You can run tests with:

```bash
python manage.py test
```

## Usage Example 💡

Here’s a simple example of how you can use Django Startup to quickly generate an app and start developing.

1. Create a new app:

   ```bash
   python manage.py generate_app blog
   ```

2. This will generate:
   - **`serializers.py`**: Serializers for your models.
   - **`views.py`**: Pre-defined views for common operations.
   - **`utils.py`**: Utility functions for common operations.
   - **Sample data** for your models.
   
3. Create models and migrations as usual:

   ```python
   from django.db import models

   class Post(models.Model):
       title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
       body = models.TextField()
       created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
   ```

4. Run migrations:

   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. Your serializers and views are already generated, ready for customization!
